# rsniffer

The idea is to create something similar to nmap.

## Usage

cargo run -- -j `number_of_threads` `ip`


#### You'll need rust and cargo(the npm of rust's world) to be able to run the code:
* [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-03-hello-cargo.html)
* [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)


Used as a project to speed the rust learning, fast and mem-safe.
